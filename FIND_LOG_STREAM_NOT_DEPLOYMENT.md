# üîç WHERE TO FIND THE ACTUAL APP ERROR

You're looking at **Deployment logs** (build/deploy history), but we need **Application logs** (runtime errors).

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECT PLACE TO CHECK

### **Step 1: Go to Log Stream**

1. Go to Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
2. Search: **"pryysm"**
3. Click: **App Services ‚Üí pryysm**
4. Left Menu: Look for **"Log stream"** or **"Logs"**
   - NOT "Deployment Center"
   - NOT "Deployment slots"
   
5. Click on **"Log stream"**

---

### **Step 2: Watch Real-Time Logs**

Once you're in Log stream, you should see:
- Real-time output from your running app
- ANY errors will show up in RED text
- This shows what's happening RIGHT NOW

---

### **Step 3: If Log Stream is Empty**

Try the Kudu Console instead:

1. Go to: https://pryysm.scm.azurewebsites.net
2. Top Menu: Click **"Debug console"**
3. Choose: **PowerShell**
4. Navigate to logs:
   ```
   cd D:\home\LogFiles
   dir
   ```
5. View the log file:
   ```
   type Application_*.log
   ```

---

## üìç WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

You should see error messages like:

```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED
```

or

```
Error: Failed to initialize database connection
```

or

```
Error: NEXTAUTH_SECRET is not set
```

---

## üéØ NEXT STEP

1. **Click on "Log stream"** in the left menu (not Deployment Center)
2. **Wait 30 seconds**
3. **Copy any RED error text** you see
4. **Share it with me**

This will show the ACTUAL problem causing the "Application Error"! ‚úÖ
