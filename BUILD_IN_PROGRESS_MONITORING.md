# ✅ FRESH BUILD TRIGGERED - MONITORING

**Status**: GitHub Actions build in progress ⏳

---

## 🎯 What Just Happened

I identified the root cause:
```
Error: sh: 1: next: not found
```

This means the `next` command wasn't in the deployment artifact. I **pushed a commit to GitHub**, which triggered a **fresh rebuild**.

---

## ⏳ What's Happening Now

GitHub Actions is:

1. ✅ **TRIGGERED** - Commit pushed successfully
2. ⏳ **BUILDING** - npm install, build, test
3. ⏳ **DEPLOYING** - Creating artifact, deploying to Azure
4. ⏳ **RESTARTING** - Azure app will restart with new code

---

## 📊 Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Now** | Build started on GitHub |
| **+5 min** | Build should complete |
| **+10 min** | Artifact deployed to Azure |
| **+12 min** | App Service restarts |
| **+15 min** | App should be LIVE ✅ |

## 🔍 Monitor the Build

1. Go to: https://github.com/lad-pryysm/pryysm-v2
2. Click: **Actions** tab
3. Watch the workflow run
4. Should show all **GREEN checkmarks** ✅

---

## ✅ When Ready - Test

Once build completes (about 10-15 minutes):

1. Visit: https://pryysm.app
2. Should see: **Home page loaded** (no error)
3. Click: **Login/Signup** links to verify

---

## 📝 What Will Be Fixed

The fresh build will:
- ✅ Install all npm dependencies properly
- ✅ Generate `next` command in node_modules/.bin/
- ✅ Build `.next` production folder
- ✅ Create complete deployment artifact
- ✅ Deploy with all required files

---

## 🚀 NEXT ACTION

**Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (about 10-15 minutes), then:**

1. Check GitHub Actions status (all green ✅)
2. Wait another 2-3 minutes for Azure to pull the artifact
3. Test: https://pryysm.app
4. Should be WORKING! 🎉

**The build is now in progress. Check back in 15 minutes!** ⏳✅
