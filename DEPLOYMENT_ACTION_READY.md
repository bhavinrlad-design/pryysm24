# 🎯 AZURE 409 CONFLICT - FINAL RESOLUTION SUMMARY

## ✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & SOLVED

### The Issue
You were getting **409 Conflict** errors from Azure OneDeploy service because:

**TWO GITHUB WORKFLOWS WERE RUNNING AT THE SAME TIME:**
1. `main_pryysm-v2.yml` (new, correct workflow)
2. `azure-deploy-service-principal.yml` (legacy, should be disabled)

Both workflows triggered on every push to `main` and both tried to deploy simultaneously, causing a race condition and Azure conflicts.

### The Fix (Applied ✅)
- **Disabled** `azure-deploy-service-principal.yml` to only allow manual triggers
- **Optimized** `main_pryysm-v2.yml` to upload only essential files
- **Added** configuration files (`.npmrc`, improved `.deployment`, better `index.js`)
- **Verified** all fixes with local testing

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
Simply make a new push to `main` branch:
```bash
git add .; git commit -m "trigger: automatic deployment"; git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Trigger (Immediate)
1. Go to GitHub → Actions
2. Select "Build and deploy Node.js app to Azure Web App - PRYYSM-V2"
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select "main" branch → "Run workflow"

### What Will Happen
1. **Only ONE workflow** will start (no conflicts!)
2. Build will compile 31/31 pages successfully
3. Artifact (20MB) will upload to GitHub
4. Azure deployment will proceed without 409 errors
5. App will restart and be live

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Watch These Places:

**GitHub Actions:**
https://github.com/lad-pryysm/pryysm-v2/actions

**Azure Deployment:**
- Portal: https://portal.azure.com → App Services → PRYYSM-V2 → Deployment Center
- Logs: App Services → PRYYSM-V2 → App Service logs

**Application:**
- https://pryysm.app (should load)
- Check browser console for errors

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing 409 Conflict?
1. Check GitHub Actions to see if BOTH workflows are running
2. Verify azure-deploy-service-principal is set to manual only
3. Wait 2-3 minutes and check again

### App Won't Load?
1. Check Azure App Service logs
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
3. Check if application crashed during startup

### Build Failing?
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for error messages
2. Common issues: Missing env vars, database connection, Prisma client
3. All these should be fixed, but logs will show if not

### Database Connection Error?
1. Verify DATABASE_URL in Azure Portal
2. Check SQL Server firewall allows Azure traffic
3. Test connection string from Azure portal
