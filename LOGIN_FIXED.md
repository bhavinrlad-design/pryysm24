# ✅ LOGIN ISSUE RESOLVED - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## 🎯 What Was Wrong & How It's Fixed

You couldn't login because **the demo users weren't in the database yet**. 

### The Problem
```
❌ Login page loads ✓
❌ Can enter credentials
❌ Click Sign In
❌ Nothing happens / "Invalid credentials"
❌ Can't get past login page
❌ Can't reach dashboard
```

### The Cause
The database was created, but it was **empty** - no demo users were seeded!

### The Solution ✅
I ran the seed script which:
1. ✅ Cleared old data
2. ✅ Created 3 demo users with passwords
3. ✅ Hashed passwords securely
4. ✅ Populated database
5. ✅ Ready for login!

## 🔐 PASSWORD HASHING

### How Demo Passwords Work
```
Plain text password:   demo123
Hashed in database:    $2a$10$...
When you login:
- You enter: demo123
- System checks against: $2a$10$...
- Uses bcryptjs to compare
- If match: ✅ Login successful
```

### Security ✅
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Bcryptjs hashing (10 rounds)
- Industry standard security
- Safe for production

---

## 📊 DATABASE STATUS

### What's Seeded
```
✅ User table populated
   - demo@prysm.com (hashed password)
   - admin@prysm.com (hashed password)
   - LAD@admin.com (hashed password)

✅ Printer data
   - 2 test printers

✅ Material data
   - 2 test materials

✅ Print Job data
   - 2 test print jobs
```

### View Your Database (Local Only)
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Opens: http://localhost:5555
# See all data
# Click "User" table
# See 3 demo users
```

---

## ⚡ IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Check 1: Dev Server Running?
```bash
# Terminal should show:
# ✓ Ready in 6.3s
# - Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Check 2: Visit Correct URL
```
✅ Correct:    http://localhost:3000/login
❌ Wrong:      http://localhost:3000
❌ Wrong:      http://localhost:3000/
```

### Check 3: Clear Browser Cache
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + Delete
Mac:     Cmd + Shift + Delete
Or:      Right-click → Empty cache
```

### Check 4: Try Different Account
```
If demo@prysm.com fails, try:
admin@prysm.com / AdminPassword123

If both fail:
1. Check dev server console for errors
2. See "TROUBLESHOOTING" section below
```

### Check 5: Reseed Database
```bash
npm run db:seed
# Should recreate demo users
```
