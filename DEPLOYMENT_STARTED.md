Message:
"Fix login/signup authentication: Add Prisma singleton, 
database connection verification, and enhanced error logging"

## ✨ Key Improvements Now Live

- Better HTTP status codes (503 for DB unavailable, etc.)

✅ **Debugging**
- Detailed console logging with emoji indicators (🔐📤📥✅❌)
- Step-by-step logging for each authentication attempt

✅ **Reliability**
- Connection verified before every API call
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks

✅ **Build Quality**
- All routes properly implemented
- No empty files causing compilation errors

---

## 🔐 Security Status

✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt
✅ Input validation enabled
✅ SQL injection protected (Prisma ORM)
✅ Error messages don't leak user info
✅ Database connection properly secured
