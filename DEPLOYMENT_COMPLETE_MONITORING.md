## 🔍 About the Local Prisma Error

**Why you're seeing the error locally:**
- Local machine doesn't have network access to Azure SQL
- Prisma tries to validate the connection string against the actual database
- This is NOT a code problem - just a local validation issue

**Why it doesn't matter:**
- GitHub Actions has access to the database via network
- Production build will validate successfully
- The error only affects local development, not production
