# 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - App Returns 503

The app is returning **HTTP 503 "Service loading..."** which means:

✅ Server started  
✅ `.next` build folder exists  
✅ Prisma client exists  
❌ **But Next.js is failing to load**

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

The `server-ultra-simple.js` is loading Next.js in the background, but Next.js **is crashing on startup**. The error is being swallowed silently.

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX - SWITCH TO STANDARD NEXT.JS

Instead of using the complex `server-ultra-simple.js`, let's use Next.js's standard `start` command.

### **Step 1: Fix the startup in Azure**

1. Go to Azure Portal → App Services → pryysm
2. Left Menu: Click **"Configuration"**
3. Find or Add: **"Startup Command"** setting
4. Set it to:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
5. Click **SAVE**
6. Click **CONTINUE**
7. Click **RESTART**

---

### **OR Step 2: Use Procfile (Alternative)**

Create/update `Procfile` in the root:

```
web: npm run start
```

Then commit and push to trigger a rebuild.

## 📋 WHAT TO DO NOW

**Option A: UPDATE STARTUP COMMAND (Fastest - 5 minutes)**

1. Azure Portal → App Services → pryysm → Configuration
2. Add "Startup Command": `npm run start`
3. Save → Continue → Restart
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Test https://pryysm.app

**Option B: PUSH CODE CHANGE (If Option A doesn't work)**

If Option A doesn't work, I'll guide you through pushing a code fix.

---

## ✅ WHY THIS WILL FIX IT

- ✅ Uses Next.js's official startup
- ✅ Handles environment variables correctly
- ✅ Loads Prisma client properly
- ✅ No custom server complexity

---

**Try Option A first! It should work immediately.** 🚀
