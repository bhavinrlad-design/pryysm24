## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE

### If Build Fails
**Location**: GitHub Actions workflow
**Action**: Check logs → Look for errors
**Expected**: Should NOT see Prisma errors (we removed that step)
**Solution**: See LIVE_MONITORING_GUIDE.md

### If Deployment Fails
**Location**: Azure Deployment Center
**Action**: Check error message
**Expected**: Should complete successfully
**Solution**: Check AZURE_CREDENTIALS secret in GitHub

### If App Shows Error
**Location**: https://pryysm.app
**Action**: Check Azure logs (App Service → Log stream)
**Expected**: Should see "Server running at http://0.0.0.0:8080"
**Solution**: Check all 4 environment variables in Azure Portal
