IMPACT: None - build completed successfully
SOLUTION: This is normal for Windows/v6 - no action needed
```

### 2. Critical Dependency Warning
```
WARNING: require() in @opentelemetry/instrumentation
REASON: genkit-ai uses OpenTelemetry
IMPACT: None - does not affect build or runtime
SOLUTION: This is normal - no action needed
```
