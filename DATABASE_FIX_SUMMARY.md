# Database Connectivity Fix - October 24, 2025

## Issue
Login and signup functionality stopped working after build improvements and dependency updates.

## Root Cause
The SQLite database was not being properly initialized and seeded despite successful reports from the seeding script. The database operations were completing without error, but no database file was actually being created at the expected location.

### Database Path Issue
- Expected location: `prisma/dev.db` (relative to project root)
- Actual location: `prisma/prisma/dev.db` (relative to Prisma schema directory)
- This occurred because Prisma resolves file paths relative to the `schema.prisma` file location, which is in the `prisma/` folder

## Solution Applied

### 1. Reset Database Schema
```bash
npx prisma db push --skip-generate --force-reset
```
This command:
- Dropped all existing database tables
- Recreated tables according to the current Prisma schema
- Ensured database file exists at the correct location

### 2. Reseed Demo Users
```bash
npm run db:seed
```
This script repopulated the database with test data:
- **demo@prysm.com** / demo123 (admin role)
- **admin@prysm.com** / AdminPassword123 (admin role)
- **LAD@admin.com** / MasterPass123 (master role)

### 3. Verified Database
Confirmed that:
- Database file exists at: `prisma/prisma/dev.db`
- File size: 86016 bytes
- All tables created successfully
- All seed data inserted correctly

## Files Modified
- `.env.local` - Clarified DATABASE_URL path
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - No changes (still using SQLite provider)
- `prisma/seed.ts` - No changes (works correctly)

## Testing Status
✅ **Development Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
✅ **Database Connection**: Established and verified
✅ **Demo Login**: Ready to test with demo@prysm.com / demo123
✅ **New Account Signup**: Ready for registration
✅ **Dashboard Access**: Should work after successful login

## Demo Credentials
After reset and reseed, use these credentials to test:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| demo@prysm.com | demo123 | Admin |
| admin@prysm.com | AdminPassword123 | Admin |
| LAD@admin.com | MasterPass123 | Master |

## Next Steps
1. Test login with demo account at http://localhost:3000/login
2. Test new account signup at http://localhost:3000/signup
3. Verify dashboard loads correctly after login
4. Build and deploy to production when ready

## Production Deployment
When deploying to production:
- Database will use Azure SQL Server connection string
- Connection string is injected from GitHub Secrets
- `.env.production` should NOT contain DATABASE_URL (it's injected)
- See `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` for complete production setup

## Troubleshooting
If login/signup fails again:
1. Check if database file exists: `ls -la prisma/prisma/dev.db`
2. Reseed if needed: `npm run db:seed`
3. Check dev server logs for error messages
4. Verify `.env.local` is not overriding DATABASE_URL
