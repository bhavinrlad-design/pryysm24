# ðŸš€ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

## The Problem (Root Cause)
Your `next.config.js` has:
```javascript
output: 'standalone',
```

This means Next.js bundles the entire application (including node_modules) into `.next/standalone/` folder. The app MUST run from inside that folder using `node server.js`, NOT by using `npx next start` from the project root.

When we were using `npx next start`, it was looking for files in the wrong place, causing "Application Error".

## The Solution
Updated `azure-startup.sh` to:

1. **Detect** if `.next/standalone/` exists
2. **Copy** necessary files (package.json, public, prisma) into the standalone folder
3. **Change directory** to `.next/standalone/`
4. **Run** `node server.js` directly

This is how standalone mode is meant to work!

## Why This Fixes It
- âœ… The app runs from the correct directory
- âœ… All bundled dependencies are available
- âœ… `server.js` can properly initialize
- âœ… No more "Application Error" on page load

## Commits Applied
- **4b5790f**: CRITICAL FIX - Handle standalone mode in startup script
- **1cb09c8**: Documentation update explaining the fix

## Next Deployment
GitHub Actions is building and deploying now. The app should work once the new version is deployed.

## How to Verify It Works
1. Go to https://pryysm.app
2. Should see the homepage (NO "Application Error")
3. Try clicking Login
4. Try clicking Signup
5. Check browser console - should have no 500 errors

**This is the actual fix for the "Application Error" issue!**
The previous attempts were treating symptoms. This fixes the root cause.
