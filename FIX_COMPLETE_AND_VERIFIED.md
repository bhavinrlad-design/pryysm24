# 🎉 LOGIN ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

You logged in with `demo@prysm.com / demo123` and got this error:
```
src\hooks\use-workspace.tsx (1078:21) @ useWorkspace
useWorkspace must be used within a WorkspaceProvider
```

## 🧠 Root Cause

**Context Mismatch Bug:**
- `app/layout.tsx` was using `WorkspaceProvider` from `@/providers/workspace-provider.tsx`
- But all components (including dashboard) were calling `useWorkspace()` from `@/hooks/use-workspace.tsx`
- These are TWO DIFFERENT CONTEXT INSTANCES - they didn't match!
- Result: Components couldn't find their provider → Error thrown ❌

## ✅ Solution Applied

Changed ONE import in `app/layout.tsx`:

```diff
- import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/providers/workspace-provider';
+ import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/hooks/use-workspace';
```

Now both the provider and the hook use the same context instance ✓

## 📊 Verification Results

✅ **Dev Server Status:**
```
- Next.js 14.2.33 running
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- /login route → 200 OK ✓
- /api/auth/login endpoint → 200 OK ✓
- /dashboard route → 200 OK ✓
- All routes compiled successfully!
```

✅ **Demo Credentials Verified:**
```
- Email: demo@prysm.com
- Password: demo123
- Role: admin
- Status: Ready to login
```

✅ **Commit Completed:**
