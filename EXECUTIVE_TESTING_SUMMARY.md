## üéì What's Happening Now

Your application is currently in the **cold start initialization phase**. This is completely normal for first deployment after a period of inactivity.

### Why 503 Responses?
- App Service is loading the 309 MB artifact
- Node.js runtime is starting
- Prisma client is initializing
- Database connection is being established
- Application warmup is running

### Is This Normal?
‚úÖ **YES** - This is expected behavior for:
- First deployment after creation
- Long idle periods (>5-10 minutes)
- Azure App Service standard tier
- Cold start can take 5-10 minutes

### What Happens Next?
1. App transitions to 200 OK responses (2-5 min)
2. Home page becomes accessible
3. All API endpoints respond
4. Database queries execute
5. Login/Signup functionality available
6. Full production readiness achieved

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Manual Testing Steps

### Immediate (After app responds)
1. [ ] Visit home page

3. [ ] Verify page layout
4. [ ] Click navigation links

### Short-term
1. [ ] Test login page
2. [ ] Test signup page
3. [ ] Create test account
4. [ ] Test login with new account
5. [ ] Verify dashboard loads
6. [ ] Test payment page

### Medium-term
1. [ ] Monitor error logs
2. [ ] Check performance
3. [ ] Test all API endpoints
4. [ ] Verify database operations
5. [ ] Test edge cases
