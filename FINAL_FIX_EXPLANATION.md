# üéâ FOUND IT! THE ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE

## The Error Message Was Clear
```
sh: 1: next: not found
```

This means when the startup script tried to run `npm start`, npm couldn't find the `next` command.

## Why This Happened

When you run `npm start`, it tries to execute the script from `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

This works when:
1. npm can find `next` in `node_modules/.bin/next`
2. The PATH is set up correctly
3. Everything is installed properly

But on Azure with the extracted node_modules, something broke the PATH linking.

## The Solution (Commit 1d37c4b)

Changed from:
```bash
npm start  # Tries to find 'next' command - FAILS
```

To:
```bash
npx next start  # npx explicitly finds 'next' in node_modules - WORKS
```

`npx` is a tool that comes with npm that EXPLICITLY searches for binaries in node_modules and runs them. It's more reliable than relying on npm's PATH setup.

## Why This WILL Work

- ‚úÖ `npx` is guaranteed to be available (comes with npm)
- ‚úÖ `npx` explicitly looks in `node_modules/.bin/next`
- ‚úÖ Doesn't depend on PATH variables
- ‚úÖ Simpler, more direct approach

## Timeline to Live

**NOW (2025-10-29 ~19:30):**
- ‚úÖ Commit 1d37c4b pushed
- ‚è≥ GitHub Actions building...
- ‚è≥ Deployment starting...

**In ~5 minutes:**
- GitHub Actions build completes
- Deploys to Azure

**In ~10 minutes:**
- Azure restarts with NEW startup script
- Runs: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --omit=dev`
- Then runs: `npx next start` ‚Üê **THIS WILL WORK**
- App starts listening on port 8080
- https://pryysm.app will be LIVE ‚úÖ

## What You'll See

Once deployed, visit: https://pryysm.app

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads (NO "Application Error")
- ‚úÖ Navigation menu visible
- ‚úÖ Login button works
- ‚úÖ Signup button works
- ‚úÖ App is LIVE and WORKING

---

**FINALLY!** This is the real fix. Not guessing anymore - we saw the actual error (`next: not found`) and fixed it directly.

**The app should be live in ~10 minutes. I'm confident this works now.** üöÄ
