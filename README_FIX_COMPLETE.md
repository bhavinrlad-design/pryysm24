# 🎊 PRYYSM V2 - POST-LOGIN ERROR FIXED! ✅

## 📌 The Issue You Reported

After logging in with demo credentials (`demo@prysm.com / demo123`), you got this error:

```
src\hooks\use-workspace.tsx (1078:21) @ useWorkspace
useWorkspace must be used within a WorkspaceProvider
```

The app wouldn't let you past the login page.

---

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### The Problem
There was a **Context Mismatch** in the code:
- `app/layout.tsx` was importing `WorkspaceProvider` from the wrong location
- This created TWO different context instances that didn't match
- When components tried to use `useWorkspace()`, they couldn't find their provider
- Result: **Error thrown, dashboard failed to load** ❌

### The Solution
Changed ONE import in `app/layout.tsx`:

**File: `app/layout.tsx`**
```diff
- import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/providers/workspace-provider';
+ import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/hooks/use-workspace';
```

This ensures:
✅ The provider and hook use the SAME context instance  
✅ Components can find their provider  
✅ Dashboard loads without errors  
✅ Full functionality restored
