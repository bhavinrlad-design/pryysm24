# ðŸš¨ URGENT: GET ACTUAL ERROR LOGS

## This is the FASTEST way to fix this

You MUST check the Azure logs to see the REAL error message. Stop deploying - we need to see what's actually happening.

### STEP 1: Go to Azure Portal
1. Open https://portal.azure.com
2. Search for "PRYYSM-V2" app service
3. Click on it

### STEP 2: Check Log Stream (LIVE LOGS)
1. On left sidebar, scroll down to "Monitoring"
2. Click **"Log Stream"**
3. You'll see LIVE logs as the app tries to start

### STEP 3: Restart the app and watch logs
1. Top of page, click **"Restart"** button
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Watch the Log Stream - you'll see error messages

### STEP 4: Screenshot the error
Take a screenshot of whatever error appears and share it with me.

## Why This Matters

The error message will tell us EXACTLY what's wrong:
- `Cannot find module 'next'` â†’ Missing dependency issue
- `ECONNREFUSED` â†’ Database connection issue
- `listen EADDRINUSE` â†’ Port already in use
- `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory` â†’ Missing file
- Any other specific error â†’ We'll fix that specific thing

**Without the actual error, we're just guessing.**
