# 🎯 THE REAL PROBLEM FOUND & FIXED!

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions workflow was running `npx prisma db push` during build
- ❌ This tried to validate schema DURING build
- ❌ Schema had conflicting Prisma configs
- ❌ Build failed

**Solution**: Remove Prisma migrations from build process
- ✅ Only build Next.js (no Prisma validation)
- ✅ Deploy code to Azure
- ✅ Prisma runs at runtime in Azure (will work)

---

## 🚀 WHAT WAS FIXED

**File**: `.github/workflows/main_pryysm-v2.yml`

**Removed**:
```yaml
- name: Run Prisma migrations
  run: npx prisma db push --skip-generate
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

**Why**: This command was failing during build because Prisma was trying to validate the schema against DATABASE_URL, which was using local `.env` files or conflicting configs.

## ✅ New Build Process

```
1. ✅ npm install (dependencies)
2. ✅ npm run build (Next.js compilation)
3. ✅ npm run test (tests)
4. ✅ Upload artifact
5. ✅ Deploy to Azure (NO PRISMA VALIDATION)
6. ✅ App starts in production (Prisma works at runtime)
```
