# New User Blank Slate Welcome Screen

## Feature Overview

When new users sign up and access the dashboard for the first time, they now see a **blank slate welcome screen** instead of an empty dashboard with no data. This guides them through the initial setup steps.

## What New Users See

### Welcome Screen Components

1. **Welcome Hero Card**
   - Friendly greeting: "Welcome to Pryysm!"
   - Explains the blank canvas concept
   - Option to dismiss and go to main dashboard

2. **Three Getting Started Steps**
   - **Step 1: Add Printers** - Register 3D printers and specifications
   - **Step 2: Add Materials** - Catalog filaments, resins, and costs
   - **Step 3: Create First Order** - Create first print job and assign to printer

3. **Quick Tips Section**
   - Best practices for setup
   - Link to AI Chat help
   - Costing module introduction
   - Tips for accurate quotes

## How It Works

### Signup Flow
1. User creates account with email/password/company info
2. Auth service sets `localStorage['new_signup'] = 'true'`
3. User redirected to dashboard
4. Dashboard detects new user and shows welcome screen

### Persistence
- Welcome screen only shows once per new signup
- Users can dismiss it with the X button
- Dismissal tracked in `localStorage['welcome_dismissed'] = 'true'`
- After dismissal, user sees normal empty dashboard

### Returning Users
- After dismissal, welcome screen won't appear again
- Regular dashboard with data loads normally

## Code Structure

### File Modified
`src/components/dashboard/dashboard-client.tsx`

### New Component: `WelcomeBlankSlate()`
- Renders welcome card, getting started steps, and quick tips
- Handles dismissal with X button
- Checks localStorage for dismissed state

### Dashboard Logic
```tsx
// Check if new user
const newSignup = localStorage.getItem('new_signup') === 'true'
const notDismissed = localStorage.getItem('welcome_dismissed') !== 'true'
const isNewUser = newSignup && notDismissed

// Conditionally render
{isNewUser ? (
  <WelcomeBlankSlate />
) : (
  // Normal dashboard
)}
```
