# Why Production Login Wasn't Working - Quick Summary

## The Issue
✗ Local login: **WORKING** (SQLite)  
✗ Production login: **NOT WORKING** (Azure SQL)  
✗ Same code, different databases

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions deployment workflow was **not running database migrations**. This means:
- Azure SQL database existed but had **no tables**
- Login API tried to query `User` table → table doesn't exist → error
- User thought: "invalid email or password" but actually: "table not found"

## The Fix
Added ONE step to the GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Run Prisma migrations
  run: npx prisma db push --skip-generate --skip-seed
```

This ensures database schema is created whenever the app is deployed.

## Timeline
- **Before**: Deploy → Build app → Upload to Azure (no DB setup) → **BROKEN**
- **After**: Deploy → Build app → **Create database schema** → Upload to Azure → **WORKS**

## When It Works
✅ Next time you push to `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
1. Build your app
2. Run `prisma db push` (creates all tables on Azure SQL)
3. Deploy the app

✅ Production login will then work

## What Changed
1. `.github/workflows/main_pryysm-v2.yml` - Added migration step
2. `lib/db-init.js` - New database check on startup
3. `server-sync.js` - Call DB init before starting server

Everything already committed and pushed to GitHub.

## Next Action
Push a change to trigger deployment, or manually run the workflow in GitHub Actions.
