# 🎯 PRYYSM V2 - POST-LOGIN ISSUE FIXED

## ✅ Problem Solved

You reported this error after logging in with demo credentials:
```
src\hooks\use-workspace.tsx (1078:21) @ useWorkspace
useWorkspace must be used within a WorkspaceProvider
```

### Root Cause Identified
The error was caused by a **Context Mismatch**:

1. **app/layout.tsx** was wrapping the app with:
   ```tsx
   import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/providers/workspace-provider';
   ```

2. But **useWorkspace hook** (and all components) expected:
   ```tsx
   import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/hooks/use-workspace';
   ```

3. These are **TWO DIFFERENT CONTEXT INSTANCES**, so when components called `useWorkspace()`, they couldn't find the provider!

---

## 🔧 The Fix Applied

**File Updated:** `app/layout.tsx`

```diff
- import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/providers/workspace-provider';
+ import { WorkspaceProvider } from '@/hooks/use-workspace';
```

This single change ensures:
- ✅ The provider wrapping the app matches the context hook
- ✅ All components can access `useWorkspace()` 
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ Navigation works correctly

## ✅ Verification Complete

### Dev Server Status
```
✓ Running at http://localhost:3000
✓ All routes compiled successfully:
  - /             200 OK
  - /login        200 OK  
  - /api/auth/login 200 OK
  - /dashboard    200 OK
✓ No compilation errors
```

## 📋 Why This Happened

### The Problem in Code
```
BEFORE (BROKEN):
  Root Layout
    └─ AuthProvider
        └─ WorkspaceProvider (Context A from @/providers/workspace-provider)
            └─ Dashboard Component
                └─ calls useWorkspace()
                    └─ looks for Context A from @/hooks/use-workspace
                    └─ NOT FOUND! (Context A ≠ Context B)
                    └─ ERROR THROWN! ❌
```

### After Fix
```
AFTER (CORRECT):
  Root Layout
    └─ AuthProvider
        └─ WorkspaceProvider (Context from @/hooks/use-workspace)
            └─ Dashboard Component
                └─ calls useWorkspace()
                    └─ finds Context from @/hooks/use-workspace
                    └─ MATCH! ✅
                    └─ Dashboard renders! ✅
```

## 📝 Technical Details

### What We Fixed
- **File:** `app/layout.tsx` (2 line change)
- **Import Path:** Updated from `@/providers/workspace-provider` to `@/hooks/use-workspace`
- **Impact:** Enables all workspace-dependent components to work after login

### Why It Matters
The `WorkspaceProvider` creates a React Context that stores:
- Workspace state and configuration
- Orders, customers, printers, materials data
- Functions to update and manage data
- Various business logic helpers

All components using `useWorkspace()` need access to this exact context instance. By importing from the wrong location, components couldn't find it, causing the error.

### How to Avoid This in Future
- Keep provider definitions close to their hooks
- Use consistent import paths
- Test context providers in each layout before deploying
