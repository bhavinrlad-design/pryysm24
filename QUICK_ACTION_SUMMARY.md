# 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION SUMMARY

## ✅ What I Found & Fixed

**THE PROBLEM:**
- Signup ✅ worked because it stored data
- Login ❌ failed because database provider was wrong
- Prisma schema was set to `SQLite` but production uses `Azure SQL Server`

**THE FIX:**
- Changed `prisma/schema.prisma` line 7: `provider = "sqlserver"`
- Now matches your actual production database
- Automatically deployed to Azure

## 🚨 If Login STILL Doesn't Work

**Open your browser console (F12) and tell me:**
1. What exact error message appears (red text)?
2. Can you access the signup page?
3. Did signup show a success message?

**Most Common Issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "User not found" | User wasn't saved during signup |
| "Invalid password" | Wrong password entered |
| "Failed to fetch" | API server not responding (check Azure) |
| Login just hangs | Clear cache, try incognito window |
