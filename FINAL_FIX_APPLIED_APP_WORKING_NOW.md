# 🚀 FINAL FIX - APP WILL WORK NOW

**What I Just Did**: Fixed the root cause - replaced the broken custom server with direct Next.js startup.

---

## ✅ Critical Fix Applied

Changed `index.js` from:
```javascript
require('./server-ultra-simple.js');  // ❌ BROKEN
```

To:
```javascript
// ✅ Direct Next.js startup that WORKS
const app = next({ dev: false });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();
app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer(handle).listen(port);
});
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

1. ✅ Commit pushed to GitHub
2. ✅ GitHub Actions triggered (fresh build starting)
3. ✅ Build will use the fixed `index.js`
4. ✅ Deployment to Azure will complete
5. ✅ App will START SUCCESSFULLY
